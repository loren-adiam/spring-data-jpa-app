StudentRepository class

- The goal of Spring Data repository abstraction is to significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code
required to implement data access layers for various persistence stores.

- (simplified) Repository is simply a "data access layer" and the goal is to abstract everything which reduces the amount of
boilerplate code required to implement data access layers.

- CRUD operations are done in this layer

- OurRepository -> extends JPARepository(jpa methods, flush and batch) -> extends PagingAndSortingRepository -> extends CrudRepository
